## About This Project

This project was developed as part of my coursework at IUT, where specific standards were imposed, including the use of French for all code and comments. It's important to note that this approach differs from my usual programming practices.

## Important Note

The code in this repository may not reflect my usual coding style but rather the requirements imposed by my academic environment. I apologize for any deviation from the standards that you may observe.
